Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis
Problem Statement :-The objective of this project is to design and develop a robust and accurate Credit Card Fraud Detection System that can effectively identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Why this problem :-Addressing credit card fraud through an accurate and efficient fraud detection system helps protect both financial institutions and consumers. It provides peace of mind to customers, maintains the integrity of the financial system

Solution :-The solution to the credit card fraud detection problem involves implementing a comprehensive and sophisticated Credit Card Fraud Detection System. Here are the key components and steps of the solution 1)Data Collection 2)Data Preprocessing 3)Feature Engineering 4)Real-Time Analysis etc

Model Applying :- Logistic Regression and Random ForestCLassifier

Overall Conclusion for Logistic regression :-The logistic regression model achieved an impressive overall accuracy of approximately 94.21%.In summary, the logistic regression model demonstrates strong performance in credit card fraud detection, with high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. It successfully identifies both fraudulent and legitimate transactions, which is crucial for maintaining a reliable and trustworthy credit card fraud detection system

**Our Machine Learning model's scores Accuracy = 94% F1-score = 94% Precision = 90% Recall = 99% **

Overall Colclusion for Random ForestCLassifier :-The Random Forest Classifier demonstrates a strong performance similar to the Logistic Regression model. It achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores, making it an effective and reliable choice for credit card fraud detection. Like before, it's crucial to consider other performance metrics and compare the results with other models to ensure the Random Forest Classifier's robustness and generalizability in different scenarios.

**Our Machine Learning model's scores Accuracy = 93% F1-score = 93% Precision = 90% Recall = 95% **

**Final Conclusion :- Logistic regression is best machine learning model for Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection **
